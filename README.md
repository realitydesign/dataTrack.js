dataTrack.js
============
#####A simple cross-browser jQuery plugin to make custom event tracking easy to implement.
You can use dataTrack.js with Google's Universal Analytics (analytics.js), Google's Classic Analytics (ga.js), or just about any other tracking system that records events with a Category, Action, Label, and (optional) Value. More impressively, you can configure dataTrack.js to send events to multiple tracking systems at the same time.


dataTrack.js gives you access to 3 custom HTML5 data types: **data-track**, **data-dynamic-label**, & **data-track-children**. Using these data types you can easily track any element in your HTML without having to write a single line of javascript and save yourself hundreds—or even thousands—of lines of redundant and unmaintanable code.


#####Initialize dataTrack with standard configuration:
```javascript
$.dataTrack();
```
